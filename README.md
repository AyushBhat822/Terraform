# Terraform
In this repo I share the Terraform code learnt during the training at LinuxWorld Informatics under the guidance of World Record Holder Vimal Daga.
Files usage:
1. ec2storage.tf - In this file I launched an server in AWS cloud services, then created an ebs volume and at last attached the ebs volume to the server.
